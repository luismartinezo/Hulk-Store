## Instalation

- You must clone and download the repository, we run the command followed by the repository path like this: `git clone` https://github.com/luismartinezo/Hulk-Store.git

- We install the development dependencies with the command `npm install`.

- We create a Mysql database called `hulk store` and run the sql script in the `FrontEnd/DataBase` folders to create the `products` table.

- In our favorite IDE NetBean, Eclipse or another we import the Maven - Spring Boot project that is inside the folders `FrontEnd/BackEnd` that we cloned from the git repository.

## Development Server

- FRONTEND: We run the command `ng serve` to start the development server. We open in our browser the url: `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will be automatically reloaded with each change in the files.

- BACKEND: In our IDE we run the imported project with right click on it, `Run As` - `Spring Boot App`
